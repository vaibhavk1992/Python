Q3. How to find the total number of working days between two dates.
Ans- Better go for a dimension that has all such attributes like days,weeks,months,NUMBER OF WORKING DAY,from there we can directly use th thing.
How to make that dimension?
Teradata suggest there is a concept of calender table from thhere we can directly fetch the range of dates between two dates and then withing the extracted dates put a where condition like where extracted dates in (Working days)

select count(*) from 
(select extracted_datees from calender_table where dates in between date 1 and date2)inr
where inr.extracted_dates in(Working_days)
