Description
Nikhil, one of the social worker, realises that it’s good to feed the animals. So he decides to own a goat & named her Tinie along with a farm to feed her.

The farm comprises W x H (1 ≤ W ≤ 750; 1 ≤ H ≤ 750) squares and is partitioned into one or more separate pastures by rocks both large and small. Every pasture contains some grass and some rocks. Unfortunately, Tinie just loves to eat, eat and eat the grass. Tinie can move from any square to any other square i.e. horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. Tinie can’t cross the rocks because they hurt her feet, and of course, she can’t leave the farm.

So, Tinie wants to know the maximum number of squares of grass that she can eat. Nikhil has a map of his farm, where a ‘.’ represents a square of grass, and a ‘*’ represents a rock. Consider this 10x8 map and a detailed breakdown of the extent of each of its three pastures:

  ...*....**  |  111*....**   ...*2222**    ...*....**  
  ..**....**  |  11**....**   ..**2222**    ..**....**  
  ...*....**  |  111*....**   ...*2222**    ...*....**  
  ...**.*.**  |  111**.*.**   ...**2*2**    ...**.*.**  
  ***.**.***  |  ***1**.***   ***.**2***    ***.**.***
  ...**.*.**  |  111**.*.**   ...**2*2**    ...**.*.**
  ...*.*****  |  111*.*****   ...*2*****    ...*.*****
  ...***..**  |  111***..**   ...***..**    ...***33**

Pasture 1 has 21 squares; pasture 2 has 18 squares; pasture 3 has 2 squares.
Thus Tinie should choose pasture 1 with 21 squares to maximise the grass she can eat.

Note: Tinie can start from any position on the field.

Input

    Line 1: Two space-separated integers: W and H
    Lines 2…H+1: Line i+1 describes field row i with W characters (and no spaces), each either ‘.’ or ‘*’

Output

    Line 1: A single integer that represents the maximum number of squares of grass that Tinie can eat.
